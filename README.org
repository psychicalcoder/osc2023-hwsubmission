* How To Submit Homework

** Overview
For those who are familiar with git.
1. TA creates a branch named your student ID.
2. You fork this repo.
3. Base on the =<student id>= branch, you do your labs and put your code in the
   forked repo.
4. Create a PR to the =<student id>= branch in this repo to submit the homework.
5. TA merges the PR as a proof that you have demo the lab.

** Fork The Repo
Fork the repository on Github.
Uncheck the "Copy the =main= branch only".
If you don't want to see a lot of redundant branches in the forked repo, keep
the checkbox checked and follow the [[git-usage.org][guide]] to fetch your own branch.

** Clone To Your Computer
Clone the forked repo and switch to the branch named your student id.
If you cannot find your branch, ask TAs for help.

** Specify Personal Information
Write down the following info in your =README.md= (or =README.org=, =README.rst=
etc.)
+ Github account name
+ Student ID
+ Your name
+ Any other information you want

** Implement Your Kernel
Design and implement your kernel in the forked repository.
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Make good use of =.gitignore=. In the git history, we do not want to see
  binaries, objetive files, __MACOSX, python caches, super large test files,
  or any file that can be compiled from your source code.
#+END_QUOTE

** Create PR
Create a Github pull request before your demo. Once the PR is created, you can
always push additional commits to your forked repo before the PR is merged. The
changes will automatically appear within the PR.

* Happy Coding ~
As long as you meet the above requirements and the PR can be merged without
conflicts, we do not care about what the forked repo look like. You can rename
your branch, change the default branch, or do whatever you want.
