** How to add a branch that is in the upstream repo but not in your forked repo?

1. Add osc2023 as the upstream
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  git remote upstream https://github.com/oscapstone/osc2023.git
#+END_SRC

2. Checkout your branch from the upstream
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  git checkout --track upstream/<your student id>
#+END_SRC

3. Push the branch to your forked repo
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  git push origin <your student id>
#+END_SRC

** How to remove a file from the git history?

*Warning:* If you not no fully understand what are you doing, please backup the
repo. TAs are not responsible for any mistake in this section or any damage
produced by your git operation. If you need to modify the history that has been
merged into the upstream repo, please contact with TA.

*** case 1: the file is added in the latest commit
Just modify the latest commit
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  git rm --cached <filename>
  git commit --amend -C HEAD
#+END_SRC
What if you have pushed to Github? Force push again.
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  git push -f origin <your student id>
#+END_SRC

*** case 2: the file is added in a old history.

I suggest you to use git rebase to modify the history.
First, use =git log= to find the commit you added the file.
Suppose the commit id is =7a45f90=. Use the commmit before =7a45f90= as the
newbase.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  git rebase -i 7a45f90^
#+END_SRC

This command pops up the editor. Modify =pick 7a45f90= to =edit 7a45f90=, then
save and close the editor.
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  git rm --cached <filename>
  git commit --amend
#+END_SRC

Repeatedly use the following command until the rebase procedue finished.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  git rebase --continue
  # if there is conflict
  git rm <filename>
#+END_SRC

Use might need to force push to the github repo.

*Warning:* force push is not revertable.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  git push -f origin
#+END_SRC
